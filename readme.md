## Goal
The goal of the system is to load, analyze, manipulate and save DNA sequences.
## Description
DNA sequences are composed of four types of nucleotides;</br>
The nucleotides are marked A (Adenine), G (Guanine), C (Cytosine) and T (Thymine).</br>
A full DNA molecule usually consists of two strands, connected to each other in base-pair connections: As with Ts,  and Cs with Gs.</br>
Three successive nucleotides generate a codon, which might be chemically "read" in various ways.</br>
The system will interact with the user through a CLI (Command Line Interface) that uses the standard I/O. Using that interface, the user will be able to load DNA sequences from files, to analyze them, to manipulate them (e.g. by extracting sequence slices or by modifying the sequence), and to store modified sequences and reports.</br>
The commands are detailed in the following sections.</br>
### The Command Line Interface (CLI)
The prompt of the CLI is usually > cmd >>></br>
#### Sequences
The application's most important elements are sequences.</br>
These are DNA sequences (composed of the four characters A, C, T and G).</br>
Each sequence that is held in the app's memory has a name and sequence number.</br>
When referring to a sequence in commands, unless otherwise defined, it is possible to refer it either by its ID or by its name.</br>
Reference to the sequence number is done using the hash character #</br>
For example:</br>
#107 means sequence number 107.</br>
Reference to the sequence name is done using the at character @</br>
For example:</br>
@dolly-dna refers to the sequence named dolly-dna.</br>
### Common CLI markings
● [argument] - Words starting with "[", ending with "]" represent optional arguments.</br>
● \<argument> - Words starting with "<", ending with ">" represent required arguments. </br>
● arg1|arg2 - Pipe sign ("|") between words represents that each one of them can be used.</br>
Example using bash command cp:</br>
cp [-r|-f] \<source> [\<source2> [\<source3> ...]] \<destination></br>
Means that:</br>
● cp can be used with flag -r or with flag -f, but they both are optional.</br>
● After the flags (if they exist) must be the source files. At least one, but can be many.</br>
● At the end must be the destination.</br>
### Sequence Creation Commands
The following commands are being used to ​generate new sequences​:
#### new
> cmd >>> new \<sequence> [@\<sequence_name>]</br>
Creates a new sequence, as described by the followed sequence.</br>
If the ​@\<sequence_name> is used, then this will be the name of the new sequence.</br>
Otherwise, a default name will be provided - ​seq1 (or ​seq2, ​seq3 and so on, if the
name is already taken).</br>
The new sequence, its name and its number (internal ID, starting with 1) are printed.</br>
For example:</br>
> cmd >>> new ATACTGCCTGAATAC @short_seq</br>
will create that sequence;</br>
if this is the first sequence, it will be numbered "1" and the following will be printed:</br>
[1] short_seq: ATACTGCCTGAATAC</br>
#### load
> cmd >>> load \<file_name> [@\<sequence_name>]</br>
loads the sequence from the file, assigns it with a number (ID) and a default name, if one was not provided (based on the file name, possibly postfixed with a number if the name already exists), and prints it.</br>
For example:</br>
> cmd >>> load my_dna_seq.rawdna</br>
will load the sequence from the file my_dna_seq.rawdna and will print its assigned ID, its name and the sequence (no more than 40 chars;</br>
So, a typical output might be:</br>
[14] my_dna_seq: AACGTTTTTGAACACCAGTCAACACATTG</br>
#### dup
> cmd >>> dup \<seq> [@\<new_seq_name>]</br>
duplicates the sequence.</br>
If a new name is not provided, then it will be based on the name of ​\<seq>, suffixed by ​_1 (or ​_2, ​_3, ... if the name is already taken).</br>
For example:</br>
> cmd >>> dup #22</br>
will result in</br>
[23] conseq_1_1: ATACTGCCTGAATACAGCATAGCATTGCCT</br>
### Sequence Manipulation Commands
The following commands ​manipulate existing sequences​:</br>
Their default behavior is to modify the source sequence in-place (that is, the original ID and name of the sequence are left the same, only its content is modified).</br>
● If a colon ​: appears after the command's argument, then the original</br>
sequence is left untouched, and a new sequence is generated with the
manipulation results.</br>
● If an argument of the form ​@\<new_seq_name> is provided after the colon, then this is the name of the new sequence.</br>
● Otherwise, if ​@@ instead, then the name of the new sequence is automatically generated by the app.</br>
Each command might generate a different default name.</br>
When a sequence is required as a source, both ID (​#<seq_id>) or name (​@seq_name) are acceptable, unless otherwise defined.</br>
#### slice
> cmd >>> slice \<seq> \<from_ind> \<to_ind> [: [@\<new_seq_name>|@@]]</br>
Slices the sequence, so that starts in <from_ind> (0-based index) and ends in \<to_ind>(inclusive).</br>
If @<new_seq_name> is provided, the results will create a new sequence with that name.</br>
If @@ is provided, the results will create a new sequence with auto-generate name, based on the name of the original sequence, with the suffix _s1 (or, if that name is already occupied, with the suffix _s2, and so on).</br>
For example:</br>
Assuming that the former short_seq's ID is 1, the following command:</br>
> cmd >>> slice #1 4 9</br>
will change the sequence to TGCCT (Letters at indices 4,5,6,7,8) and print the output:</br>
[1] short_seq: TGCCT</br>
If @@ was provided to the same command, then sequence 1 would have not changed, and a new sequence would have been generated instead.</br>
A typical call, then, might look like:</br>
> cmd >>> slice #1 4 8 : @@</br>
[19] short_seq_s1: TGCCT</br>
#### replace
> cmd >>> replace \<seq> \<index> \<new_letter> [: [@\<new_seq_name>|@@]]</br>
replaces the letter in the (0-based) index of \​<seq> by \<new_letter>.
If ​@\<new_seq_name> is provided, the original sequence is left untouched and the result is put in a newly created sequence with that name.</br>
If ​@@ is provided, the name is based on the original sequence, with the suffix ​_r1 (or, if that name is already existing, ​_r2 and so on).</br>
The command might get more than a single replacement. In that case, after \​<seq> there will be more than one pair of ​<index> and ​\<new_letter>.</br>
For example:</br>
> cmd >>> replace @short_seq_s1 0 A 3 A : @repl_seq</br>
will result in the following output:</br>
[20] repl_seq: AGCAT</br>
